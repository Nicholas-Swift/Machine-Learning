Each stage will prompt you with the basic steps for importing, cleaning, exploring, training, and testing--but the implementation of each stage will be up to you.  Remember to use the documentation for pandas, numpy, and sklearn as necessary.  If you don't know how to do something, use the internet to figure it out until you do.  You'll be presenting your model during the start of Thursday's class.\n",

How will you deal with missing values?  Once your data set is \"clean\", remember to split it into a training set and a testing set.  In general, you want to have a 70/30 split between your training and testing sets, respectively."
