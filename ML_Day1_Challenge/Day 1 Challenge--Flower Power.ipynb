    "### Goals\n",
    "* Get comfortable working in jupyter notebooks\n",
    "* Get practice with some of the basic functionality in Pandas, especially in regards to DataFrames and Series.\n",
    "* Explore a classic data set, and write our fist classifier!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How To Make Use of This Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are awesome, and a big part of the first lesson will be making sure that you're awesome at using them!  Here are a couple pro-tips on how to make the best use of this notebook during this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ** Take notes right in the middle of the notebook--its just markdown and html!**  Double click on this cell to explore the markdown that makes the cell so pretty, and to read a secret message about your instructor<!--THAT ISN'T ALAN's REAL HAIR COLOR!!!-->. If you see a place where you want to make a note in markdown, highlight any cell and then go up to \"Insert\" on the menu above. You can insert a cell above or below any other cell in the notebook.  You can also change cells from markdown to code, and vice versa.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Make use of all the cool IPython magic commands.**  Don't understand a function?  Call it with a question mark a at the end to see the documentation for it (or a double question mark to see the actual code for that function!).  Want to use ls to see what a file name is called, but don't want to have to open a pesky terminal window?  Just use % ls!  For a full look at the Ipython documentations and all the cool magic commands contained therein, select \"Help\" in the menu bar and follow the link to Ipython's Docs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Poke around in the code!**  Don't understand how something works?  Change the code around until you do.  The great thing about Jupyter Notebooks is that each cell can be run individually, which will save you a ton of time and headaches.  To run any cell, just highlight the cell and press shift + enter.  In a code cell, this will run the code.  In a markdown cell, this will render the markdown.  Each time you run a code cell, the output number to the left of the cell will increment by 1.  Be sure to pay attention to this if you start running cells out of order.  Finally, if you want to run all cells at the same time (sequentially, starting from the top and working downwards), you can find that option inside the \"Cell\" menu up top.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we'll be working with the famous <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris\">Iris Data Set</a>, courtesy of the <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html\">UC Irvine Machine Learning Data Set Repository.</a>  This data set consists of measurements of 150 different Iris flowers--50 Iris Setosa, 50 Iris Virginicas, and 50 Iris Versicolors.\n",

    "#### Data Wrangling in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing the data from a .txt file into a Pandas Dataframe.  This will give us some practice importing data, and using Pandas Dataframes in organize and manipulate data as needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing Data with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll explore our data set by generating some summary statistics on what we're looking at.  More importantly, we'll visualize our data set to see if anything stands out to us. We'll also take a quick detour to look at an example of how summary statistics can be misleading, and why we should always *visualize our data!*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing a Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The final thing we'll do is to write a basic classifier using sklearn.  Don't get discouraged if you don't understand what is going on in this step.  Our only goal here is to demystify the basic process of creating a model using machine learning algorithms.  It's NOT important that you understand the code at this point--instead, focus on the general steps that make up the process: splitting our data into **_Training_** and **_Testing_**, training our model, and validating it using testing data.

    "**We'll begin** by reading our data set into a Dataframe.  There are two main object types in pandas that we'll want to get comortable with: *Series* and *Dataframe*.  It's important that you understand the quirks and use cases of each ASAP, because the sooner we understand our tools, the sooner we can start focusing on the fun stuff.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A Pandas **_Series_** is a 1-dimensional array of data.  Python rules still apply, so the data contained can be heterogeneous--that is, the list can still contain multiple data types.  You can think of a series as a single row or single column of values from a table.  (Pro-tip:  If you want to sanitize the data in a series by making it all the same type, cast it to a numpy array before creating the Series object!  Example below).  Pandas Series Documentation available <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html\">here</a>!\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pandas **_Dataframe_** is a multidimensional container of data.  The easiest way to understand dataframes is to think of them as multidimensional arrays, or matrices.  Under the hood, they're basically a dictionary of multiple Series. Each individual row or column can be accessed as a Series, and Dataframes have all kinds of cool bells and whistles that allow you to add, drop, manipulate, or sort columns or rows based off of conditionals for the values in a given row or column.  This makes dataframes really powerful for preprocessing, when you're cleaning your data set and getting it in an acceptable state to run through an ML algorithm.  A common example might be something like replacing all empty cells in a column with the mean value for that column, or grabbing all the rows that meet a condition for a certain column.

However, this isn't always the case, and doesn't seem to be here.  In some cases, summary statistics can even be misleading (more on that later)!  In this lesson, we won't spend any time discussing the various summary statistics and what they *could* tell us, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't know them.  As a rule of thumb, if you don't understand any of outputs of the .describe() method, consider reviewing descriptive statistics. There will come a time where you'll need to understand what standard deviation is and why it's important!\n",

    "We'll use a **_scatterplot_**, since it seems to fit pretty intuitively with our data set.  We have three different types of flowers, and measurements on the length and width of the petals and sepals.  Let's start by plotting the sepal lengths and widths of all flowers, but denote each type with its own color.  If we get lucky, we'll be able to see some visual trends based on the type of flower.  "

The answer is that without a solid understanding of the shape of your data, you're flying blind.  Could you just build a model and be done with it?  Sure--but how would you know if you could *trust* your classifier?  How would you know which machine learning algorithm(s) to choose for your model in the first place?  Data exploration is a crucial step in machine learning because it can give us information that points us in the right direction, as well as intuition that can help us determine if we can *trust* our model.\n"

We need to learn what sorts of questions machine learning can answer, get a feel for the types of questions we should ask when trying to solve a problem, what sorts of models we can use, how to train a model, and how to tell if we can trust our model once it's built. \n",

    "We may not have covered this foundational stuff yet, but we're going to build a model anyways.  Don't worry if you don't understand what's going on yet--that's okay, you will soon.  We'll build a classifier  now, just so you can get a feel for the process, and what it looks like to train, test, and validate a model.  In a few weeks, once you've learned the foundational stuff, see if you can come back to this and see if you understand it.  Bonus points if you can improve the accuracy of the model!"
